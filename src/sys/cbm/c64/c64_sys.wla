; c64_sys.wla : hardware abstraction specifics for the C64
;===============================================================================


; the system-specific routine for printing a single character, in the native
; character encoding: (for Commodore machines, this is PETSCII)
;
; in this case, a wrapper isn't needed, so to avoid an unnecessary JMP-chain
; we provide the KERNAL ROM address rather than a local routine
;
; NOTE: the KERNAL entrypoint is at $FFD2, but this goes through some
;       additional jumps and checks which output device is selected;
;       for speed we use a ROM address that always prints to the screen
;
